Hello :)

In this repo I am going to be publishing the programs that I code for my Differential Geometry class.

These programs have the purpose to avoid doing the calculus by hand, to avoid mistakes. The list of programs are:

- `plotting.py` Plots the alpha(t) curve, in 2 or 3 dimensions

- `tanSpeedAce.py` Returns the tangent vector, the speed and the acceleration of the vector alpha(t)

- `arcLenght.py` Returns the arc lenght of alpha(t) from _a_ to _b_

- `naturalParameter.py` Reparametrized the alpha(t) curve by arc's lenght alpha(s)

- `Frenet-Serret.py` Returns the Frenet-Serret Equations of alpha(t)
